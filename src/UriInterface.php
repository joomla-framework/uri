	 * Section 4.1. The method concatenates the various components of the URI,
	 * using the appropriate delimiters:
	 *
	 * - If a scheme is present, it MUST be suffixed by ":".
	 * - If an authority is present, it MUST be prefixed by "//".
	 * - The path can be concatenated without delimiters. But there are two
	 *   cases where the path has to be adjusted to make the URI reference
	 *   valid as PHP does not allow to throw an exception in __toString():
	 *     - If the path is rootless and an authority is present, the path MUST
	 *       be prefixed by "/".
	 *     - If the path is starting with more than one "/" and no authority is
	 *       present, the starting slashes MUST be reduced to one.
	 * - If a query is present, it MUST be prefixed by "?".
	 * - If a fragment is present, it MUST be prefixed by "#".
